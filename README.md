# CUSTOM ENUMERABLES

In this project, I tried to recreate some built-in methods in Enumarable, only using `yield`, block and proc.


## Created method
* \#my_each  
* \#my_each_with_index  
* \#my_map  
* \#my_select
* \#my_all?
* \#my_any?
* \#my_none?
* \#my_count
* \#my_map
* \#my_inject

## Note
Those methods only works on arrays.  #my_inject doesn't accept symbol parameter.
